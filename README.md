# Newton's Moon Cookies üç™

Welcome to the official app for the best cookies this side of the Milky Way, baked fresh on the moon by Newton!

This is a full-stack React application powered by a Manifest backend. It showcases a simple e-commerce platform for a whimsical product.

- **User Authentication**: Customers and astronauts can sign up and log in.
- **Role-Based Access**: A special 'astronaut' role (that's Newton!) allows for creating and managing the cookie inventory.
- **Product Management**: Astronauts can add new cookies, including a name, description, price, inventory count, and a photo.
- **Feature-Aware UI**:
  - **Image Uploader**: A drag-and-drop interface for uploading cookie photos.
  - **Choice Selector**: A simple button group to manage the cookie's baking status (`dough`, `in the oven`, `ready for sale`).
